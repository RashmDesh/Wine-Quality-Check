Wine Quality Check Project.ipynb ;- This file contain wine datasets EDA and applyting  ML. 
Red_Wine_quality.py:-   This file contains Streamlite app code with  wine quality prediction using DT_Model.pkl  
DT_Model.pkl:-This is decision tree model which we are going to use for wine quality checking.


ABOUT DATASET
The Wine Quality dataset contains information about various physicochemical properties of wines. e are going to download and load the dataset into Python and perform an initial analysis to disclose what is inside it. And applying some Machine learning algorithms.

FEATURES DESCRIPTION
Fixed acidity: It indicates the amount of tartaric acid in wine and is measured in g/dm3
Volatile acidity: It indicates the amount of acetic acid in the wine. It is measured in g/dm3.
Citric acid: It indicates the amount of citric acid in the wine. It is also measured in g/dm3
Residual sugar: It indicates the amount of sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process is done. It is also measured in g/dm3
Free sulfur dioxide: It measures the amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in free form. It is also measured in g/dm3
Total sulfur dioxide: It measures the total amount of SO2 in the wine. This chemical works as an antioxidant and antimicrobial agent.
Density: It indicates the density of the wine and is measured in g/dm3.
pH: It indicates the pH value of the wine. The range of value is between 0 to 14.0, which indicates very high acidity, and 14 indicates basic acidity.
Sulphates: It indicates the amount of potassium sulphate in the wine. It is also measured in g/dm3.
Alcohol: It indicates the alcohol content in the wine.
Quality: It indicates the quality of the wine, which is ranged from 1 to 10. Here, the higher the value is, the better the wine.

Decision tree Model :- DT_Model.pkl. This is decision tree model which we are going to use for wine quality checking.
